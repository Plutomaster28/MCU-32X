# Pipeline Stages of the MCU-32X Processor

The MCU-32X processor implements a 5-stage pipeline architecture to enhance instruction throughput and overall performance. Each stage of the pipeline is designed to handle a specific part of the instruction execution process. Below is a detailed description of each stage:

## 1. Fetch Stage
The fetch stage is responsible for retrieving the next instruction from memory. The program counter (PC) is used to track the address of the instruction to be fetched. Once the instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.

## 2. Decode Stage
In the decode stage, the fetched instruction is decoded to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved. Control signals are generated based on the instruction type, which will guide the subsequent stages of the pipeline.

## 3. Execute Stage
The execute stage performs the actual computation specified by the instruction. This may involve arithmetic or logical operations carried out by the ALU, or it may involve accessing data from registers or memory.

## 4. Memory Stage
During the memory stage, any data read or write operations are executed. If the instruction requires accessing memory (for example, load or store instructions), the appropriate data is fetched from or written to the memory.

## 5. Writeback Stage
The writeback stage is where the results of the executed instruction are written back to the register file. This ensures that the changes made during the execution are reflected in the CPU's state.

## Pipeline Considerations
- **Hazards**: The pipeline may encounter hazards such as data hazards, control hazards, and structural hazards. Techniques such as forwarding, stalling, and branch prediction may be employed to mitigate these issues.
- **Performance**: The use of a pipeline allows for multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously, significantly improving the throughput of the processor compared to a non-pipelined architecture.

This pipeline design is crucial for achieving the expected performance of the MCU-32X, making it suitable for running a homebrew OS or game kernel.
